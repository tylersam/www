    <p>
      In this project, I extended a 3rd party customer loyalty platform to
      handled some unique business requirements that the product could not
      accomplish.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      I built embedded web views for loyalty reward tracking and
      customer-specific donation tracking in the 3rd party app. Customers can
      now easily view how many meals have been donated on their behalf and view
      their loyalty status.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Additionally, I developed a system that handles point-requests for
      customers who forgot to log their visit at the time of purchase. While
      building these features, I also integrated the loyalty registrations and
      visits with point of sale data in the company
      <a href="/projects/dashboard/">Dashboard</a>.

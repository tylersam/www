    <p>
      My wife and I currently live in Dallas with our dog Gus. When there isn't
      an ongoing pandemic, we enjoy traveling, hiking, and watching baseball. I
      never refuse good coffee or anything with chocolate.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      I value quality over quantity. I appreciate deep thinking and mutual
      respect in the workplace. My goal is to work in a place where I can make a
      difference and my contributions matter.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      I'm a lifelong learner. I enjoy keeping up with the evolution of web
      development by listening to podcasts such as
      <a href="https://www.bikeshed.fm/">The Bike Shed</a>,
      <a href="https://remoteruby.transistor.fm/">Remote Ruby</a>, and
      <a href="https://www.founderquestpodcast.com/">Founder Quest</a>
      as well as reading newsletters such as
      <a href="https://rubyweekly.com/">Ruby Weekly</a>,
      <a href="https://javascriptweekly.com/">JavaScript Weekly</a>, and
      <a href="https://elixir-radar.com/">Elixir Radar</a>.

    <p>
      My wife and I currently live in Dallas with our dog Gus. When there isn't
      an ongoing pandemic, we enjoy traveling, hiking, and watching baseball. I
      never refuse good coffee or anything with chocolate.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      I value quality over quantity. I appreciate deep thinking and mutual
      respect in the workplace. My goal is to work in a place where I can make a
      difference and my contribution matters.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      I'm a lifelong learner. I enjoy keeping up with the evolution of web
      development by listening to podcasts such as The Bike Shed, Remote Ruby,
      and Founder Quest as well as reading newsletters such as Ruby Weekly,
      Javascript Weekly, and Elixir Radar.
